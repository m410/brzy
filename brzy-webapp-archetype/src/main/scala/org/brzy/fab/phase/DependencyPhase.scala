/**
 * A build phase is a set of tasks, grouped together to accomplish a goal.  This is very
 * similar in concept to maven phases.  A phase can depend on other phases.  An when
 * running the phase, the dependencies are run first.  When running just a task in the phase
 * is called to run only it's dependencies task are run. The phase dependent phases are not.
