Hello,

Brzy Web Framework is a Scala based, full stack application framework.  You Can find more information on the wiki.
"http://wiki.github.com/m410/brzy/":http://wiki.github.com/m410/brzy/

This is still a very early release but it's starting to take shape nicely.  Some of the
most difficult issues I have left have to do with the build system.  The mvc portion of
the code is almost ready.

Take a look at some of the modules here:
"http://github.com/m410/brzy-modules":http://github.com/m410/brzy-modules

And a sample working webapp can be found here:
"http://github.com/m410/brzy-examples/tree/master/squeryl-scalate/":http://github.com/m410/brzy-examples/tree/master/squeryl-scalate/

Thanks for taking a look.
M!ke
